# Ethics & Safety

## Intended Use
This project is intended for academic research and defensive evaluation in a controlled environment.

## Lab Isolation
All experiments are conducted in an isolated lab using VMs. No production networks or real user data are involved.

## Dual-Use Considerations
The topic relates to evasion techniques that could be misused. To reduce risk:
- weaponized exploit payloads are not published
- the repo focuses on measurement methodology, configuration, and derived metrics
- raw logs are kept local; only derived summaries are tracked

## Privacy
No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected. If any identifiers appear in logs, they should be scrubbed before sharing.
